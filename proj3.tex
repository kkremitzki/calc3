{\bf Hello} World!

I want to talk about double integrals, expressed as $\int_c^d\int_a^b f(x,y) dx$.

% Show xy-region of integration with intervals in 2d
% Show rectangular prisms approximating surface in 3d
\section{Approximation with Rectangular Prisms}
    \ldots text \ldots

% Show f(x,y) = 4 - xÂ² + y as a surface in 3d
\section{Volume as a Double Integral}
    \ldots text \ldots

% Show surface with more prisms in x-direction
% Show surface ``               '' y-direction
% Show surface with 30 prisms in x-direction.
\section{Varying Approximations of Volume}
    \ldots text \ldots

\end{document}
